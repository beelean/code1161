TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Got the general idea of what the course of computational design is.
Downloaded all the files, signed up the accounts and set up the system. While downing the apps, had problems to install the apps in my laptop, even it showed that it actually downded succuessfully. I also found that it is unclear to find out the "save" button in ios system, wondering if it is saved automatically.
Through this lesson, aiming to get used to the apps and have the ability to set up everthing again if getting something troubles that needed to reset it.
