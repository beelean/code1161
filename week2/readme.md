TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Today just had a terrible default on getting everthing showing up, as there is no "hello 41" in my system, so this makes me recolon everthing up and starts everthing again. This dragged me not following the class.
Each week when starts a new folder, just make sure pull from the master, just make sure to reduce this issue happen.
While doing the excersises, the format and language really turn me down. Especially while modifing a lot of times, there are still have prombles on that.
Tips for doing the right thing are dedug and test every time, finding the problems by giving hints of the debug console.
stuck on exercise3, need some helps to define the quesitons.
