TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Today just had a terrible default on getting everthing showing up, as there is no "hello 41" in my system, so this makes me recolon everthing up and starts everthing again. This dragged me not following the class.
Each week when starts a new folder, just make sure pull from the master, just make sure to reduce this issue happen.
