TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


From the Lecture, Rachel provides the ideas how to work well in analysing the data.

Find different sources/places where to find Datasets.

-Kaggle (more eailer if using Kaggle kennels rather than Jupyter notebook)
-Github
-gov.au


CSV is a format of file to download and start with the assignment.

  Import all the installaitons are essential
  Then 
  Loading a dataset using:
  df = pd.read_csv()

Still not clear how to add or delete colums in Coding.
